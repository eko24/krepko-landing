# Krepko
Just markup implementation of [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/1819382-Landing-page-for-Invest-in-stock-site?list=users&offset=7) design by [Rashed](https://dribbble.com/rakabir).

It won't be used by me in any commercial purposes.
I'm doing this only for imporving my markup skills.

## Setup

You need install following node modules, or skip this step if they already installed:  
`npm i gulp bower -g`

Then run `gulp serve` to start development.
Or `gulp build` to build an optimized version of landing page.

## Copyright
